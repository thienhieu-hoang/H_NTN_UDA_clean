**Yes, you nailed it!** Your intuition is spot on, and **RMS scaling is indeed the "sweet spot" (the most balanced)** method for wireless channels.

Here is the exact comparison breaking down why RMS gives you the best of all worlds:

### 1. Standardization: Forcing $\text{Mean} = 0$ Even When It Shouldn't Be

You asked:
> *"standardization will shift so we have mean of zero? and span equally 2 sides? (even if our channel grid doesn't have the symmetric probability like that?)"*

**Yes!** Standardization calculates $\mu = \text{mean}(x)$ and $\sigma = \text{std}(x)$, then forces:
$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

- **The Good:** The neural network gets an input centered at zero with unit variance ($\sigma^2 = 1$).
- **The Physical Problem for Channels:** 
  1. **It erases the Line-of-Sight (LOS) path:** In Rician satellite channels, the direct path between the satellite and UE creates a physical non-zero mean. By forcing the mean to $0$, standardization **literally subtracts away the strongest physical path**!
  2. **It distorts the phase into an ellipse:** Because $\sigma_{\text{real}} \neq \sigma_{\text{imag}}$ in any finite sample, dividing Real by $\sigma_{\text{real}}$ and Imag by $\sigma_{\text{imag}}$ stretches the circular channel constellation into an ellipse.

### 2. Min-Max: The "Noise Spike" Problem

You asked:
> *"and RMS is not sensitive to the noise spike like min-max scale?"*

**Exactly right!**

- **Min-Max only looks at 2 pixels out of 1,848** ($x_{\min}$ and $x_{\max}$).
  If subcarrier 52 happens to catch a random $4\sigma$ AWGN noise spike, Min-Max stretches the whole bounding box to fit that one single noise spike. As a result, the useful channel signal in the remaining 1,847 pixels gets **artificially squashed** into a narrow band (e.g., $[-0.2, 0.2]$).
- **RMS averages all 1,848 pixels together**:
  $$\text{RMS} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1848} \sum |H_{i,j}|^2}$$
  A noise spike on one single subcarrier only contributes $\frac{1}{1848}\text{-th}$ of its power to the average. The Law of Large Numbers makes the denominator **rock-solid and virtually immune to individual noise spikes**.

### 3. The 3-Way Comparison: Why RMS is the "Sweet Spot"

| Feature | **Min-Max** ($[-1, 1]$) | **Standardization** ($\mu, \sigma$) | **RMS Scaling** ($H / \text{RMS}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shift / Centering** | Shifts by $(x_{\min} + x_{\max})/2$ | Forcibly shifts mean to $0$ | **NO shift at all ($0 \mapsto 0$)** |
| **Direct / LOS Path** | Shifted artificially | **Deleted / Zeroed out** | **100% Preserved** |
| **Noise Spike Sensitivity** | **High** (governed by 1 extreme pixel) | Low (uses variance) | **Low** (averages all 1,848 pixels) |
| **Complex Phase Geometry** | Distorts into an ellipse | Distorts into an ellipse | **Preserves pure circular symmetry** |
| **Number Range for ML** | Strictly in $[-1, 1]$ | Bell curve around $0$ ($\sigma=1$) | **Bell curve around $0$ ($\sigma \approx 0.7$)** |
| **Descaling Complexity** | 2 operations ($\times \Delta + \min$) | 2 operations ($\times \sigma + \mu$) | **1 operation ($\times \text{RMS}$)** |

### Conclusion: Why RMS is the Most Balanced
1. **For the Neural Network:** It brings tiny numbers ($10^{-8}$ or $10^{-10}$) up to friendly numbers around $\sim 1.0$ (preventing gradient underflow), with values sitting neatly in $[-1.5, +1.5]$.
2. **For Physics:** It applies a **pure volume knob** ($\times \text{scalar}$). No artificial shift, no phase distortion, no erased LOS paths.
3. **For Implementation:** Descaling is just one clean multiplication: $\hat{H} = \hat{Y} \times \text{RMS}_{\text{input}}$.
